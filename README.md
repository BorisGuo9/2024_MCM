Our research paper analyzes the influence and characteristics of "momentum" in tennis. To achieve this goal, we have identified features that affect tennis players and used them to train our network. We used a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) for supervised learning and predicted the probability of each player scoring at every match moment. This approach helps us evaluate which player performs better at specific times during the game. We also visualize the game's dynamics by plotting the win probability of each point for a player.

We explore the idea of "momentum" in tennis by conducting a series of calculations. This concept is closely related to the effect of each point on the win probability of the entire game, set, or match. To calculate leverage and momentum, we have designed a multi-LGBM chain that substantiates the strong association between momentum and player performance using indicators such as continuous scoring and the weighted sum of win possibilities. Our findings reveal a correlation between momentum and performance, which offers insight for coaches to devise more effective strategies in tennis matches.

We propose the critical factors that determine the flow of a tennis game and their correlations. We aim to improve the advice provided to athletes. We are building on our previous research and choosing additional' multi-probability indices.' It is the weighted sum of predicted win probability in points, games, sets, or matches. We use this to determine the swing of the game and study the relationship between these swings and momentum. The weight here can be perceived as a measure of how farsighted a player is. Our methodology helps us predict and measure the game's fluctuations and identify the most vital indicators.

We tested our models using diverse and representative datasets to make them more reliable. We also evaluate model performance in competitive settings and identify factors to improve future model accuracy. This ensures that our models can be applied with precision in various competitions or tournaments.

In summary, this study provides a detailed analysis of "momentum" in tennis. It utilizes LGBM models and introduces a new "leverage" metric to evaluate momentum's impact on player performance, particularly during critical match moments. The study also identifies the key indicators of match flow and their correlations with momentum. The model's accuracy and applicability in the real world have been tested on diverse datasets, making it a significant achievement in tennis sports analytics and strategic planning.
